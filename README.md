# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
A challenge creating a work day schedule using Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js
The schedule is color coded based on the current hour and if the calendar time is in the past or present.
When you enter information into the time slot and click the blue button to "save" the information goes into localStorage and remains when you refresh the page.
